We'll need to define several message types for this assignment.
What messages do we need to pass?
    - Client <--- signal messages ---> Server
    - Client <--- chat message ---> Server
    - Client --- guess ---> Server
    - Client <--- update board state ---> Server

How are messages passed?
    - Messages are passed between Clients and the Server as data objects using sockets (TCP)
    - Serialization will be as handled cleanly and efficiently as possible
    -- Json based

How are messages handled?
    - These messages will go into an event queue and be processed by the respective server or client as events
    - Client and Server will consistently poll their event queue and take action depending on the event recieved
